truthy and falsey values they act as the shortcut in coding for instanse instead of saying if the cart quantity > 0 you can simply say that if the cart quantity and it just works 
practical wxample:
if (cartQuantity) this will retun false if the cart quantity is zero but otherwise if the cart uantity equaks a ceratain amount then the function will return false


Falsey values include NaN, false, 0 Null undefined, ''
you get nan if you get the invalid result example dividing lwtter eiht a number

undefined represents that this variable has no value

ternary operator
(condition)? "first cindition":"second condtion"

Guard operator you can use && operator to guard theat if the left fails then block the right code
false&&condole.log("you are not a human") it serves as a shortcut for if statements

the OR operator also short circuits , The or operator ascts as the default operator since it can check betweeen the consition and the other can value can be set as a default value insted of writing if else statements

those three ternary guard and default operators are the SHORTCUTS
